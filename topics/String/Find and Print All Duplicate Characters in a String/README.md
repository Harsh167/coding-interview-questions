# Find the numbers of repeated words in the input string.

##EXAMPLE

**Input:**
```
str = aabbbcdeeee
```
**Output:** 
```
a, count = 2 
b, count = 3 
e, count = 4  
```

**Explanation:**
We have used hashing here which is basically
the use of an array of fixed size no matter
what the input string is.
