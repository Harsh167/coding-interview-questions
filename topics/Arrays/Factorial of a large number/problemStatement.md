Given a number N. Find the factorial of it.

Example 1:
```
Input: N = 5
```
Output: `120`
Explanation : 
```
5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
```

Example 2:
Input: `N = 10`
Output: `3628800`
Explanation :
```
10! = 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10 = 3628800
```

Expected Time Complexity : O(N2)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000

Task: Your task is to write the code in any language to compute the factorial of a large number
